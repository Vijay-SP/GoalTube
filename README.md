## Description

* Because technology is constantly being updated, YouTube serves as a platform for these updates to reach a large audience.
* A lot of people can't afford paid courses on various Edtech platforms like Coursera, Udemy, etc.
* Thus, learning through Youtube is the only way out. But, watching Youtube tutorials does not provide credibility to showcase as a criteria of employability. 
* As a result, we created an interactive and user-friendly mobile application that will aid in the credibility of YouTube playlists.
* GoalTube is an AI platform that provides credibility to learners across all backgrounds through our dynamic and customizable test who aim to educate themselves through platforms like YouTube.
* The user can sign in with their Google account and add the YouTube playlist that they want to finish. The Playlist will not be added to the course list until it has been approved by the admin panel. Following each video, the user will be required to complete a quiz in which the questions are generated based on the subtitles extracted from the video. Users can also view and watch playlists uploaded by other users.
* If a user believes that a question or answer is incorrect, they can report it to the admin panel, and the admin panel will investigate further.
* If the user receives a certain number of passing points at the end of all videos and quizzes, they will be certified for that course.

## Applications
* GoalTube's most important application is that it can be used by anyone. Because it is not at all paid and even YouTube courses are becoming more credible, it will undoubtedly benefit students who cannot afford paid courses from Udemy, Coursera, and others.
* If it is published in collaboration with a government entity, the credibility of the certificate for courses will be enhanced even further, and the application can be made available to more schools and colleges.
* We can also use the quiz to determine whether or not the user is watching the video. Furthermore, testing your knowledge is a way to gain confidence in that subject, and thus our application will motivate users to complete the courses.

## Future scope
* Peer to peer quiz rounds after each video in a playlist - At the end of every video, the user will be asked to submit few questions along with their answer related to that video. This submitted quiz questions will be then shown to other users.
* Automate Admin panel -As the number of users grows, so will the number of playlist requests. As a result, we will implement an ML Model that will accept or deny requests based on the videos in the playlist, reducing manual work.
